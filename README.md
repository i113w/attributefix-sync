**AttributeFix Sync** is an unofficial addon for the [AttributeFix](https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/AttributeFix) mod, designed to solve the synchronization issue where modified attribute limits on the server are not reflected on the client.

## The Problem

In the original **AttributeFix**, if you modify the upper limit of an attribute (e.g., `generic.max_health` or `generic.attack_damage`) in the server configuration:
1.  The **Server** correctly calculates damage and health based on your config (e.g., capped at 5000).
2.  The **Client** still uses the default limit (e.g., 1,000,000).
3.  **Result**: Mods like Jade, WTHIT, or the vanilla health bar display incorrect values because the client isn't aware of the stricter limit enforced by the server.

## Features

This mod solves the above problem via packet synchronization:

*   **Automatic Synchronization**: When a player joins the server, the mod automatically sends all attribute limits (Max Values) configured on the server to the client.
*   **In-Memory Patching**: Upon receiving the data, the client dynamically modifies the attribute definitions in memory via Mixin.
*   **Correct Visualization**: Jade, WTHIT, and vanilla bars will now correctly display values based on the actual server limits.
*   **Pollution-Free**: When the player disconnects, the mod automatically restores the client's attribute limits to their original state, ensuring single-player worlds or other servers are not affected.

## Installation & Usage

### Dependencies
*   **Minecraft**: 1.21.1
*   **Loader**: NeoForge
*   **Required Mod**: [AttributeFix](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/attributefix)

### Usage
1.  **Server**: Required. No configuration needed. It automatically reads the final values from AttributeFix and sends them to players.
2.  **Client**: Required. Necessary to receive the synchronization packets.

## Configuration

This mod has **no** configuration file.
It directly reads the values already applied by `AttributeFix`. If you need to change attribute limits, please edit the original config files generated by `AttributeFix` (located in `config/attributefix/`).
